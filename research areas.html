                <h2>Plant-Pollinator Communities:</h2> <p><b>Using species interactions for a systems-ecology approach to evaluate conservation habitats for community resilience, disease transmission, and rare species support.</b> I used this approach to compare conventional crop field margins to the increasingly popular conservation practice called prairie strips, which are small-scale strips of native plant communities integrated into row-crop fields. While bee abundance and richness were similar, species interaction patterns indicated prairie strips had a higher chance of bee-mediated pollination services and were more supportive of rare species than conventional crop field margins. In addition, some bee genera showed beneficial body conditions correlated with reduced foraging effort and developmental stress in prairie strips compared to conventional crop field margins <a href="/assets/publications/2023 Ecological networks approach.pdf" target="_blank">(Borchardt et al., 2023)</a>. Building on this finding, I then tested if wild bee communities in prairie strips were affected by the presence or absence of an average-sized honey apiary from early to mid-summer. I found no difference in wild bee populations or interaction patterns, suggesting that honey apiaries have no adverse effect on wild bee communities in prairie strips during a majority of the year <a href="/assets/publications/2025 st clair; insecticide application.pdf" target="_blank"> (Borchardt et al., 2025)</a>. During my post-doctoral work, I am investigating if increasing the abundance and richness of a plant species that conveys a medicinal effect decreases pathogen presence in a key-spreader species without negatively impacting the broader bee and pollinator community (Ongoing post-doctoral work).</p>

                <h2>Wasps as Pollinators</h2> <p><b>Investigating the pollination services of wasps and the role of wasps in wider pollinator communities, such as pathogen transmission networks.</b> I found wasp families fill a distinct ecological niche from bees, carry similar pollen compositions on their body to bee families, and paper wasps can deposit similar amounts of pollen in a single visit to a flower as bumble bees (<a href="/assets/publications/2025 Honey bee prairie strip.pdf" target="_blank"> (Borchardt et al., 2024)</a>. I am currently investigating whether wasps share and can transmit common pathogens found in bee communities (Ongoing post-doctoral work).</p>

                <h2>Pollinator Foraging Behavior:</h2> <p><b>Using computer simulation to understand how floral community shifts impact the foraging behavior of generalist pollinators.</b> I built an individual-based model to determine how past foraging experiences influence current behavior specifically regarding the number and effect of each past experience and the cost of switching between plant species. I found that the main driver of foraging behavior is the number of past experiences used to inform behavior, which causes behavior to lag behind shifts in the floral community (Borchardt et al., in prep.).</p>
